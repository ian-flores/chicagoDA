The goal of chicagoDA is to facilitate access to the Cook County State Attorney's Office data published recently by the Cook County Government. The package is named `chicagoDA` as Chicago is the most famous city within Cook County and thus will be more recognizable.

## Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}

### Initiation


The Initiation results data presented here reflects all of the arrests that came through the door of the State's Attorneys Office (SAO). An initiation is how an arrest turns into a “case” in the courts. Most cases are initiated through a process known as felony review, in which SAO attorneys make a decision whether or not to prosecute. Cases may also be indicted by a grand jury or, in narcotics cases, filed directly by law enforcement (labeled "BOND SET (Narcotics)" in this data). Included in this data set are the defendant counts by initiation and year. This data includes felony cases handled by the Criminal, Narcotics, and Special Prosecution Bureaus. It does not include information about cases processed through the Juvenile Justice and Civil Actions Bureaus.

The data frame `initiation` has 73,029 rows and 27 variables:
