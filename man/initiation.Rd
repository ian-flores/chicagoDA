\description{
The Initiation results data presented here reflects all of the arrests that came through
the door of the State's Attorneys Office (SAO). An initiation is how an arrest turns into
a “case” in the courts. Most cases are initiated through a process known as felony review,
in which SAO attorneys make a decision whether or not to prosecute. Cases may also be
indicted by a grand jury or, in narcotics cases, filed directly by law enforcement
(labeled "BOND SET (Narcotics)" in this data). Included in this data set are the defendant
counts by initiation and year. This data includes felony cases handled by the Criminal, Narcotics,
and Special Prosecution Bureaus. It does not include information about cases processed through the
Juvenile Justice and Civil Actions Bureaus.
